            Inline is second in the cascade order and is located in the tag that is being styled. Embeded is third in cascade order and is located in the head. External is fourth in cascade order and on a seperate file that is linked to the html page.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should only use external CSS because it is last in cascade order so when you are coding you will not interfere with the job of the graphic designer.

        <p>
            The selector is used to identify what element you want to style with CSS
