    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <main>
        <p>League of Legends (LOL) is a 5v5 MOBA (Multi Player Battle Arena) and one of the most popular video games in the world. I first got into it around when I was in middle school through watching youtube videos. I enjoy watching the World Finals whenever it rolls around and my favorite team is T1 </p>
        <p>Although I have consumed a lot of LOL content I acutally haven't really played much because for most of my life I didn't have a computer. So, when the mobile version Wild Rift launched in the U.S I played it a ton and even reached the top leaderboards. These days though I have close to no free time to play. </p>
