        <h2>What is Paksu?</h2>
       
    <p>
        Paksu started as a concept by siblings Inbeom and Jiae Park for a food truck competition. “Paksu” means “clap/applause” in Korean — a nod to the joy and satisfaction we hope
        every customer feels after a bite.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
         <p>We believe that food can bring people closer together and want to share a taste of Korea with others at an affordable price. The article <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-mental-health/202501/food-a-bridge-between-cultures-and-people">Food: A Bridge Between Cultures and People</a> from Psychology Today dives deeper into this. </p>
